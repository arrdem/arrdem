Heya. I'm Reid (he/him/them), better known as @arrdem here on [twitter](https://twitter.com/arrdem) and [elsewhere](https://linkedin.com/in/arrdem).

My blog is [over there (arrdem.com)](https://arrdem.com).

While some of my OSS work survives here for purely archival purposes as this is where it was originally published, all my new work lives [elsewhere](https://git.arrdem.com).

While it may yet be found to be lawful fair use, I believe the spirit of GH's new Copilot product is one of enabling large-scale de-attribution and theft of OSS software.
While no more egregious than any of the many existing "OSS code search" websites and while responsibility for compliance may be found to fall on developers who accept Copilot "suggestions" or who knowingly copy copyrighted work I find it objectionable for GH/Microsoft to make a revenue stream out of enabling such "suggestions".
