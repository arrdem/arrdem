Heya. I'm Reid (he/him/them), better known as @arrdem here and elsewhere. My blog is [over there (arrdem.com)](https://arrdem.com).

While it may yet be found to be lawful fair use, I believe the spirit of GH's new Copilot product (and other LLMs) is one of enabling large-scale de-attribution and thus theft from the commons.
While no more egregious than any of the many existing "OSS code search" websites and while responsibility for compliance may be found to fall on developers who accept Copilot "suggestions" or who knowingly copy copyrighted work I find it objectionable to make a revenue stream out of offering such "suggestions".

As such I and my work should be found [elsewhere](https://git.tirefireind.us).
